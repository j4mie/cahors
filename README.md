**NOTE: This project has been imported from Google Code. Is has not been touched for years. I have no idea if it even works on newer versions of the Arduino. No support can or will be offered!**

Cahors (pl.n.)
==============

> The rushes of emotion triggered by overheard snatches of an old song.

From *The Deeper Meaning of Liff* by Douglas Adams and John Lloyd.

**Cahors is a MIDI sequencer for the Arduino microcontroller platform. Music is composed in code, in the form of arrays of notes and pointers to note patterns. The music is played via a MIDI synthesiser connected to the Arduino.**
